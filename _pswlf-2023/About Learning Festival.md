Public Service Learning Festival (PSWLF) is an annual learning event as part of the Public Service Week 2023 (PSW2023). This year PSWLF is redesigned to be focused and compact, with an emphasis to encourage public officers to take charge of their development. Topics such as competency-driven growth (CDG) and upskilling in sunrise areas will permeate through the various sessions. The experience will be curated to benefit all public officers, with special attention to specific groups of officers (i.e., policy officers, support officers, officers in specific job families) to support their growth and career development.

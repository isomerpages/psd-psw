<br>

### For Interested Officers
<ol type="1">
	<li>
		<b>Who do I contact if I am interested in a specific role?</b><br>
		Please indicate your interest through the Eventbrite page for each Step into My Shoes attachment/ internship. Do note that registering your interest does not automatically guarantee you the attachment as there are limited slots available. Once you have registered your interest, the host agency representative will get in touch with you and you will liaise with them directly. 
	</li>
<br>
	<li>
		<b>How will I know if I'm selected and how much time I have before I report to the agency?</b><br>
		Attachments/Internships can start as soon as possible (upon mutual agreement by yourself, the host agency, and any internal approvals that you would need to get from your reporting officer). Each host agency will have its own process or criteria for selecting the most suitable officer(s) for the attachment/internship. Some host agencies may require you to complete application form(s), provide a CV and/or undertake an interview. The host agency will also let you know if your attachment is confirmed. 
	</li>
<br>
	<li> 
		<b>What will happen to my current work?</b><br>
		As the duration of attachment varies (few days to 6 months), you will need to discuss with your reporting officer on who will be covering your current work during the attachment period. Please make sure that you have made the necessary arrangements prior to commencing your attachment.
	</li>
<br>
	<li>
		<b>How long is the attachment?</b><br>
		The programme is meant for short-term attachments, i.e., a few days up to a maximum of 6 months.
	</li>
<br>
	<li>
		<b>Will I still have a place at my current agency at the end of the programme?</b><br>
		Yes. As the programme is a short-term attachment, you will return to your current agency at the end of the programme.
	</li>
<br>
	<li>
		<b>Do I need to seek my Director's approval to participate in the programme?</b><br>
		We recommend that you discuss with your reporting officer on whether you need to inform your Director and HR of your participation in the programme.
	</li>
<br>
	<li>
		<b>How will I be paid?</b><br>
		As this programme is meant more for short-term attachments (a few days to a few months), there are no expectations to make any changes to your current salary arrangements, since your agency would also be benefitting from the programme. 
		<br>
		<br>
		For longer term attachments (i.e., secondments), we recommend that you discuss your salary and benefits entitlement with your HR. For more information on compensation, you may wish to refer to the <b>Government IM Staff 2F</b>, which can be found on the intranet.
	</li>
<br>
	<li>
		<b>Am I able to drop out in the middle of the programme?</b><br>
		It is not advisable to drop out before the programme ends. As the host agency has planned out the programme for participants, you might not reap the full benefits of the programme if you decide to leave midway. 
	</li>
<br>
	<li>
		<b>I've changed my mind. What should I do?</b><br>
		You will need to inform the host agency directly, as soon as possible.
	</li>
<br>
	<li>
		<b>How can I make the most out of this learning experience?</b><br>
		We encourage you to clarify your learning intentions or outcomes that you wish to achieve through this attachment/ internship opportunity, and discuss these with the host agency and your own supervisor/reporting officer at your 'home' agency. It is also good practice to reflect on your experience during and post-attachment, and share your insights with your host agency as well as with colleagues back at your workplace. Sharing your experiences and insights could be done formally or casually, e.g., hosting a post-internship brownbag lunch or posting your reflections on Workplace. Be creative! :)

### For Supervisors/Reporting Officers
<ol type="1">
<li>
	<b>How long will my officer be away?</b><br>
	The programme is meant for short-term attachments. Hence, your officer will be away for a few days up to a maximum of 6 months.
</li>
<br>
<li>
	<b>How will Step Into My Shoes benefit my officer?</b><br>
	Officers will gain an understanding of how other agencies' work contribute to the broader Public Service outcomes. We suggest that you discuss with your officer and evaluate if this programme adds value to your officer's career.
</li>
<br>
<li>
	<b>Do I have to submit any form/report for the officer's participation in Step Into My Shoes?</b><br>
	This is up to the host agency to decide. We have recommended to host agencies to prepare official application forms (for reporting officers' endorsement) to facilitate mutual understanding between the host agency and the participant(s). We have also recommended that host agencies request for a report from the officer on what they have learnt during the attachment. Each host agency has the discretion to identify and confirm suitable officers for the attachment.  
</li>
<br>
<li>
	<b>If my officer is keen to participate in the short-term Step Into My Shoes attachment, do they need to apply for annual leave so that they are excused from work during that period? </b><br>
	We would like to encourage you to be as supportive of this initiative and of your officer's interest to learn and grow. As such, we advocate that officers be excused from their work duties <u>without</u> having to apply for annual leave as long as you have given your approval. In addition, we recommend that your officer shares with you information about the agreed commencement date(s) and duration of the attachment, who the host agency and department are, and the specified learning outcomes of the attachment. We also highly encourage your officer to discuss with you any covering duties arrangement(s) that need to be put in place whilst the officer is away on attachment, especially for attachments that last for more than a few days. 
</li>
<br>
<li>
	<b>How else can I best support my officer in preparing for the Step Into My Shoes attachment?</b><br>
	We recommend that you discuss with your officer the learning outcomes, and any other expectations that you might have for your officer, for the short-term attachment. Learning outcomes for such attachments might refer to any capabilities, skills or knowledge that your officer could pick up during that period that would contribute to their work. Other expectations that you might have could include sharing of the experience upon your officer's return, or strengthening relationships and connections between the two agencies. You should also discuss any covering duties arrangement(s) that need to be put in place whilst your officer is away on attachment, especially for attachments that last for more than a few days.
</li>
<br>
<li>
	<b>Does my agency need to have a one-on-one exchange of officers whilst my officer is on attachment?</b><br>
	No, this will not be necessary.
</li>

## Learning Journey
### Improving Soldier Performance Through Science

###### _#SPSPride_

Join us in this learning journey to understand how the Centre of Excellence for Solider Performance (CESP) is transforming the way our soldiers are trained and equipped through exploiting the advances in the sciences, with the aim of enhancing safety and minimising training attrition. 

Come and see how CESP's programmes train soliders to be physically and mentally stronger, and also the effects to rehabilitate our injured soliders. You will also better understand how soldier systems are now developed with a heavy emphasis on equipment ergonomics.

<i><b>Bonus:</b> A lucky few will get a chance to have their body scanned for their anthropometric dimensions, used as part of our soldier systems development. All participants will also get to view the new Load Effects Assessment Programme, designed to evaluate the effects of equipment on a soldierâ€™s performance. </i>

## Learning Journey
### Redefining Learning Spaces @ INNxCSC <font color="red"> (FULL) </font>

###### _#Digitalise #Adapt&SkillUp_

Curious to know how spaces and technologies can enhance the way you learn? Come experience for yourself how learning can be more engaging and impactful with purposeful use of learning spaces and technologies. Embark on a backstage tour to hear the INN x CSC story, find out more about what we’ve been doing so far and try out the different technologies available on site. 

A sandbox for innovation and experimentation, where public service officers can convene, collaborate and try out new ideas in a safe environment, INN x CSC was developed as an ecosystem for the Civil Service College to try out different ways of fostering learning and rethink our operational processes. You’re INNvited!

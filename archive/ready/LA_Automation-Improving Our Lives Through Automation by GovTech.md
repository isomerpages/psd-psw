## Learning Activity
### Improving Our Lives Through Automation by GovTech Singapore <font color="red"> (FULL) </font>

###### _#Digitalise #Adapt&SkillUp_

Want to find out how you can free up time and spend it more meaningfully on productive work? 

Learn how to automate routine tasks, such as: 
 1. Extracting data from a web page
 2. Filling up web forms from an Excel or CSV document, or 
 3. Automating a web task. 
 
All of which can be done through KANTU, a Chrome browser extension. 

Join us with an internet-accessible laptop! Lunch will be provided.

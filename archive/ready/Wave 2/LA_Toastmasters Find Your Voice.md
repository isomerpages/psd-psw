## Learning Activity
### Find Your Voice with Toastmasters

###### _#Adapt&SkillUp_ 

Want to be a more effective communicator? Public speaking is one of the greatest fears of most people. But fear not! All of us can learn to speak and communicate better. Join in if you'd like to pick up some communication and public speaking tips! 

This session is for all public officers who would like to learn how they can become better communicators and pick up some tips too! Civil Service Inspirations Toastmasters Club will be running a model Toastmasters session for participants to have a first-hand experience of the Toastmasters programme, and help participants find out how they can learn to be a better communicator, a better listener, and ultimately, a more effective leader. Participants will also hear from fellow public officers who have benefitted from the Toastmasters programme.

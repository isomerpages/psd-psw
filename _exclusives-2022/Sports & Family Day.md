# Sports & Family Day

The Sports & Family Day is organised by the Civil Service Club and will make a comeback this year after a two-year hiatus. The event aims at promoting a healthy lifestyle and fostering camaraderie amongst public service officers.

The event will be held at Bay East Garden (11 Rhu Cross) on 30 July 2022.

The activities include Inter-Agency sporting events, such as a Public Service Telematch and an Amazing Race, sports try-outs for officers to try their hand in, and a host of family and fringe activities to engage all participants and promote family bonding. Participation is FREE!

#### How to Achieve a Healthy Weight
A study in January 2021 of 500 adults in Singapore (age 21–74 years) found 
that 30% gained an average of 4.8kg over eight months, while 55% wants 
to  lose  weight.  Weight  gain  during  the  pandemic  is  likely  to  stem  from 
changes in eating habits, and sleep/exercise patterns, and work-from-home 
challenges.  Come  join  our  Nutrition  Educator  in  an  engaging  session  to

![PST Exhibition](/images/Highres Map.png)

**Time and Date:** 17 & 18 July 2019, 9:00am - 6:00pm<br>
**Venue:** <a href="https://www.pa.gov.sg/our-network/our-tampines-hub/contact-us">Community Auditorium, Our Tampines Hub</a>
<br>
<br>
As public officers, our work impacts the everyday lives of Singaporeans and this includes our family, friends, and not least ourselves. However, are we familiar with the various government services available at each life stage?
<br>
<br>
This year, a unique and different Public Sector Transformation (PST) Exhibition brings you through everyday questions and issues across the minds of Singaporeans at key moments in their life.  
<br>
Don’t miss out on this opportunity to stay updated with the latest across the Public Service and at the same time to connect with old friends! <br>
<br>

#### Service Journeys
<b>Service Journeys</b> are processes to help public officers understand Singaporeans’ needs from the lens of the citizens. Through these processes, we create new products and services, and reorganise ourselves to improve the journeys for Singaporeans so that they are as pleasant as possible.
<br>
<br>
Get to understand and be part of seven main service journeys of a typical Singaporean adult who goes through these stages in his/her life.

#### Subsidiary Journeys

Other than the seven main Service Journeys, there are five other Subsidiary Journeys that would further enhance the lives of Singaporeans. Read on to understand how these processes were improved!

<table>
	<tr>
		<td>
			National Service
		</td>
		<td>
			National Service (NS) is the cornerstone of Singapore’s defence and security. Our national servicemen form the backbone of the Uniformed Services that keep Singapore safe and secure. There are various stages along the NS journey, from Pre-enlistment to becoming an Operationally Ready National Serviceman, each with its own set of processes and challenges. Using the Pre-enlistment journey as an example, MINDEF will showcase how they went about enhancing the Pre-enlistees’ experience as well as an interactive showcase of initiatives to enhance the NS experience.

#### Moments of Life - Consultation Clinics
**Venue: Wellness Centre, One Tampines Hub (Level 3)**
**17-18 July 2019, 1-6pm**

The Moments of Life initiative offers citizens and businesses a convenient and efficient way of interacting with the Government at various important milestones.
<br>
<br>
It aims to allow all government e-services to be performed through one app. Moments of Life understands who you are – your needs and aspirations at different stages in life – to ensure that you make the most out of the services the Government has to offer.
<br>
<br>
Through the intuitive personalisation engine, citizens and businesses will receive relevant information and be able to perform transactions more easily on the app.     
<br>
<br> 
Come speak to us at our clinic to find out how your agency can get on board! We’ll also be giving you a sneak peek into how the app will look like!

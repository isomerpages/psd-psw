The Job Sprint is similar to existing learning stints to augment learning and development for public officers. However, by offering positions that involve transformation and/or inter-agency work, the Job Sprint serves as an opportunity for public officers to witness actual transformation on the ground and experience a real sense of change.

Apart from enhancing knowledge and skillsets to apply in their current role, this experience aims to encourage officers to contribute towards the overarching transformation movement happening within the Public Service.

More than 50 officers participated in the Job Sprint pilot which took place from 24-28 Apr 2023, and were hosted by CSC, IMDA, MCI, MINDEF, NLB and PSD across
14 positions. After the pilot, they gained a better appreciation of the work done in other agencies, and explored new areas of possibilities within their role.

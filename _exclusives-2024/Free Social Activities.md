<h4>Online Activities</h4>
<p><strong>Does An Anti-Ageing Diet Exist?</strong>
<br>Date: 4 July 2024
<br>Time: 12-1pm
<br>Location: online</p>
<p>
<br>There has long been a debate if certain types of foods or diets promote
youthfulness and anti-aging effectively. Though there is no magic bullet,
a good anti-aging strategy seeks to minimize free radicals damage &amp;
deliberate uptake of a wide range of antioxidants from a variety of foods
in one’s diet. Hear from a Nutritionist/Dietitian about an antioxidant
rich diet coupled with lifestyle changes such as smoking cessation, reduction
of excessive alcohol &amp; appropriate exercises (core, resistance, strengthening).
This plus strategies against sun damage &amp; pollutant damage for body
&amp; face will definitely go a long way to maintain one’s youthfulness
&amp; beauty.</p>

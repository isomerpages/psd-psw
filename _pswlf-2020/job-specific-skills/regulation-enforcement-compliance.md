##### <font color="darkorange"><b>Enforcement</b></font>
<font size="4">To address increasingly complex business and citizen needs, service officers need to collaborate closely within and across agencies to co-develop solutions to enhance enforcement effectiveness. We also need to engage citizens for better appreciation and co-operation with our enforcement efforts.

To help you acquire the required proficiencies, the Enforcement Competency Framework has been developed and outlines 5 key competencies and associated descriptors. For further details, please refer to the competency framework guide (intranet) found here: https://www.hrportal.gov.sg/HR Resources/LearnCompet/Competency Bank/%5bGuide%5d Enforcement Competency Framework.pdf.
 
Check out the programmes below, some of which are curated and offered only for this event.<br></font>

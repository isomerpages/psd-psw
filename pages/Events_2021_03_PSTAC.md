## Public Sector Transformation Awards Ceremony

The Public Sector Transformation (PST) Awards is a Whole-of-Government pinnacle platform to recognise and reward public officers and public agencies for excellence in their work and organisational practices. The Awards are aligned with the focus areas of this phase of PST. <br>
<br>
On 30 July 2021, the PST Awards Ceremony will recognise the extraordinary talent and innovative spirit of 84 public officers across 11 award categories. Featuring an opening by our Guest-of-Honour, Minister for Education, and Minister-in-charge of the Public Service, Mr Chan Chun Sing, awardees will be featured in new videos that bring out how the Public Service transforms to prepare for the future, even as it delivers current services well.<br>

Officers can tune in to celebrate alongside the awardees, and take part in interactive activities where tokens will be given out. Look out for the pre-event activities – “Snap a shot of Gratitude” (on Workplace@Facebook) and “Block Masters” (on the Events Ceremony page). <br>

### ABOUT PUBLIC SERVICE WEEK

Public Service Week (PSW) is an annual event that was first held in 2008. Its purpose is to cultivate a deeper appreciation and pride for the work carried out by the Public Service. PSW aims to inspire public officers to live out the core values and ethos of the Public Service, to be ready for the future, and to promote a greater sense of cohesion and community among public officers.

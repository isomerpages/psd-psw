### About Public Service Week

Public Service Week (PSW) is an annual event first held in 2008. Its purpose is to cultivate a deeper appreciation and pride for the work carried out by the Public Service. PSW aims to inspire public officers to live out the core values and ethos of the Public Service, to be ready for the future, and to promote a greater sense of cohesion and community among public officers.

The theme for PSW this year is "**Enriching Your Experience, Transforming Our Service**". It celebrates how the Public Sector Transformation movement has enriched the experience of both citizens and public officers through empowering officers to innovate and grow.

### Gifting from the Heart

In our journey as public officers, our paths frequently cross those of colleagues from other public agencies as we participate in meaningful collaborations in service of Singapore and Singaporeans. <br>
<br>
Ever wanted to send more than just a thank-you email to officers you work with outside your agency? What better way than to send them something from a curated selection of gifts from Social Service Organisations? <br>
<br>
There are special gifting  occasions like Mother's Day, Christmas Day and Valentine's Day, but how about an Inter-Agency Gifting Day? This Public Service Week, in the lead up to the One Public Service Observance Ceremony, let's celebrate by sending a "Gift from the Heart" to our colleagues, especially those from another agency. <br> 
<br>
The best part - you'll be supporting social enterprises such as <b>Foreword Coffee Roasters</b>, <b>Bizlink’s Floral & Hamper (F&H Social Enterprise)</b> and <b>Yellow Ribbon Industries Pte Ltd</b> at the same time!<br>

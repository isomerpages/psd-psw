Even as we redefine the meaning of work, reignite our sense of purpose, and transform our work, workforce and workplace, we will continue to support our officers’ well-being. In line with the themes of the PST Convention, we have lined up a series of side events from end May to July 2022 to encourage public officers to cultivate resilience and maintain physical, social and mental wellness through meaningful and fun programmes.

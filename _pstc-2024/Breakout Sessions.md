<p>A/Prof Raymond Chua
<br>Deputy Director-General of Health (Health Regulation)
<br>Ministry of Health (MOH)</p>
<p></p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>A/Prof Raymond Chua graduated from the Faculty of Medicine in the National
University of Singapore in 1997 and is a registered public health specialist
and a fellow of the Academy of Medicine since 2007. He is currently the
Deputy Director-General of Health for Health Regulation in the Ministry
of Health. He oversees the end-to-end regulations for healthcare services
and information, from policy to inspection and audit to enforcement.</p>
<p>Prior to this, he was the Group Director of the Health Products Regulation
Group in the Health Sciences Authority from 2012 to 2016 as well as the
Managing Director and Regional Medical Directors of 2 global pharmaceutical
companies, providing oversight to increase the initiation of global clinical
trials in the Asia-Pacific region. He is currently a member of multiple
regulatory committees under the Public Service Division to steer and guide
regulatory practices in public service.</p>
<p>To accommodate the rapidly evolving healthcare landscape, MOH needed to
shift its regulatory regime from a rigid premises-based 30-year-old regime
to a modular services-based one under the Healthcare Services Act (HCSA).
While HCSA applies to all healthcare services, MOH adopts a risk-based
approach in determining the services licensable under HCSA. One key feature
incorporates likely a world’s first “mode of service delivery” model within
HCSA, which provides us with the agility to regulate and enable our healthcare
services to take on physical locations, be on the move in a conveyance,
provide services either in the community or at their homes or even remotely.
To implement this effectively, MOH also rolled out a regulatory sandbox
to consult and shape the regulatory regime. In addition, MOH is working
to transform its licensing platform into a tech-enabled stakeholder-friendly
platform to support both the licensees and internal inspectors to better
determine the risks and compliance of our service providers.</p>
